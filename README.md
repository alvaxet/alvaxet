# Alex Varganov

Tech Lead based in New Zealand. 15+ years building web applications that reach production and stay there.

I build full-stack web applications — Python/Django, Elixir/Phoenix, TypeScript/Vue. I've launched many projects from scratch: SaaS platforms, automated trading systems, analytics tools, multi-agent AI systems. I also do integration work — APIs, payment gateways, AI/LLM, MCP servers — and I'm the person you call when something breaks in production and nobody knows why.

I stay hands-on. Most of my recent work has been leading architecture and delivery on long-running projects.

Fintech and algorithmic trading have a special place in my heart. My background in Economic Cybernetics and financial analysis means I speak the language, not just write the code. I genuinely love building in this space.

I prefer long-term engagements where I can own outcomes, not just ship tickets. Give me a project or a problem, I'll figure it out.
